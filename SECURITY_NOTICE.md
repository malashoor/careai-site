# üö® SECURITY NOTICE - Exposed API Keys

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Issue:** Google API keys were exposed in multiple files  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üîç **What Was Found**

Multiple Google API keys were exposed in the following files:
- `FLUTTER_ENV_INTEGRATION 2.md` - Exposed `AIzaSyAABnaXy8F8oohYqpfu5aC34INLLw9k0Hw`
- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/env.flutter` - Exposed `AIzaSyAABnaXy8F8oohYqpfu5aC34INLLw9k0Hw`
- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/env.example` - Exposed `AIzaSyAABnaXy8F8oohYqpfu5aC34INLLw9k0Hw`
- `CareAI-Flutter/scripts/create-env-file.sh` - Exposed `AIzaSyAABnaXy8F8oohYqpfu5aC34INLLw9k0Hw`
- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/lib/config/app_config.dart` - Hardcoded `AIzaSyAABnaXy8F8oohYqpfu5aC34INLLw9k0Hw`

## üõ°Ô∏è **Actions Taken**

1. ‚úÖ **Deleted files** containing exposed API keys
2. ‚úÖ **Replaced hardcoded keys** with placeholder text
3. ‚úÖ **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future exposure
4. ‚úÖ **Created this security notice** for team awareness

## üö´ **Files Removed**

- `FLUTTER_ENV_INTEGRATION 2.md`
- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/env.flutter`
- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/env.example`
- `CareAI-Flutter/scripts/create-env-file.sh`

## üîß **Files Modified**

- `CareAI-Flutter/flutter_app/lib/config/app_config.dart` - Replaced hardcoded key with placeholder

## üìã **Prevention Measures**

### **1. Environment Variables**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` files with placeholder values only
- Store real API keys in secure environment variable systems

### **2. Configuration Files**
- Never hardcode API keys in source code
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management
- Validate configuration files before committing

### **3. Documentation**
- Use placeholder values in documentation
- Never include real API keys in markdown files
- Use secure methods to share configuration details

### **4. Git Hooks**
- Consider implementing pre-commit hooks to detect API keys
- Use tools like `git-secrets` to prevent accidental commits

## üîë **How to Set Up API Keys Securely**

### **For Development:**
```bash
# Create .env.local (never commit this)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with real values
nano .env.local
```

### **For Production:**
- Use Netlify environment variables
- Use Flutter environment configuration
- Never expose keys in build artifacts

## üìû **Next Steps**

1. **Rotate the exposed Google API key** if it was used in production
2. **Review all other API keys** for potential exposure
3. **Implement security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Train team** on secure configuration management

## üö® **If You Find More Exposed Keys**

1. **Immediately remove** the exposed keys
2. **Rotate** any exposed keys
3. **Update this notice** with new findings
4. **Review** how the exposure occurred
5. **Implement** additional prevention measures
