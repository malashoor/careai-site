# CareAI Terms of Service

**Last updated:** August 19, 2025

## 1. Agreement to terms
By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization; "you" includes the organization.

## 2. The Services
CareAI provides software for health monitoring, medication management, caregiver communication, and related features. The Services are **not** a medical device and **do not** provide medical advice. In emergencies, call local emergency services.

## 3. Eligibility & accounts
You must be at least 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region) to use the Services. You are responsible for your account credentials and for all activity under your account. Keep your information accurate and up to date.

## 4. Subscriptions & billing
Paid plans are billed according to the plan you select. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions **auto‑renew** until canceled. You may cancel at any time; cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. Fees are non‑refundable except where required by law. Taxes may apply.

## 5. Acceptable use
You agree not to misuse the Services, including by:  
- Violating laws or third‑party rights.  
- Attempting to access data without authorization.  
- Interfering with or disrupting the Services.  
- Uploading malicious code or content that is unlawful, harmful, or infringing.

## 6. User content & permissions
You retain ownership of your content. You grant CareAI a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, process, transmit, and display your content as necessary to provide the Services and support. You are responsible for having appropriate permissions to share others' information.

## 7. Clinical disclaimers
CareAI is not a healthcare provider and does not practice medicine. Outputs are informational and must not be used as a substitute for professional judgment. CareAI does not handle emergency dispatch.

## 8. Third‑party services
The Services may interoperate with third‑party products or services (e.g., wearables, EHRs). Use of those services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party services.

## 9. Intellectual property
The Services, including software, design, and content (excluding your content), are owned by CareAI or its licensors and are protected by law. We grant you a limited, revocable, non‑transferable license to use the apps and site solely as permitted by these Terms.

## 10. Updates & beta features
We may modify the Services, release updates, or offer beta/preview features. Beta features are provided "as is" and may be changed or discontinued. We may require you to install updates to continue using the apps.

## 11. Termination
You may stop using the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms, do not pay fees, or if we reasonably believe there is a risk to safety, security, or legal compliance. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends; certain sections survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, liability limits, disputes).

## 12. Disclaimers
The Services are provided **"as is"** and **"as available"** without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error‑free.

## 13. Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, CareAI and our affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenues, or data, even if advised of the possibility. Our aggregate liability relating to the Services will not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 14. Indemnification
You will indemnify and hold harmless CareAI and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your breach of these Terms or misuse of the Services.

## 15. Governing law & venue
These Terms are governed by the laws of **Saudi Arabia**, excluding conflict of law rules. Courts located in **Khobar, Saudi Arabia** will have exclusive jurisdiction, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.

> **Optional (US):** Binding arbitration and class‑action waiver may be added here with a 30‑day email opt‑out procedure.

## 16. Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide notice (e.g., in‑app or email). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
